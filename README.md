To use this project, you first have to install XAMPP to have both local MySQL server and local PHP server

Once you downloaded the project folder "White Lotus" move it to the htdocs folder in the XAMPP folder

Once you moved the file you can now open XAMPP and start both MySQL and Apache servers

Now in order for the website to use the database you have to import it in MySQL (phpMyAdmin), you will find the database file in the project folder, it is named "hms_whitelotus.sql"

Now you can click on admin button of the Apache model in XAMPP to open the website, or you can just type localhost in the browser and it should take you to a directory where all projects exist, you should find White Lotus there, click on it and enjoy navigating the website and testing it! :)
